Given a pile of coins of different values,
determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
If total is 0 or less, return 0
If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1

The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of
