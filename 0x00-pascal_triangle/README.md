# Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers named after Blaise Pascal, a famous French Mathematician and Philosopher¹. It's a number pattern that's arranged in a triangular form⁵.

## Here's how it's constructed:
1. Start with "1" at the top¹.
2. Continue placing numbers below it in a triangular pattern¹.
3. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it¹⁶.

## Here are some interesting patterns within the triangle:
1. **Diagonals**: The first diagonal is just "1"s. The next diagonal has the counting numbers (1,2,3, etc). The third diagonal has the triangular numbers¹.
2. **Symmetry**: The triangle is symmetrical. The numbers on the left side have identical matching numbers on the right side, like a mirror image¹.
3. **Horizontal Sums**: The sums of the numbers in each row double each time¹.
4. **Exponents of 11**: Each line also represents the powers (exponents) of 11¹.
5. **Squares**: For the second diagonal, the square of a number is equal to the sum of the numbers next to it and below both of those¹.
6. **Fibonacci Sequence**: If you make a pattern by going up and then along, then add up the values, you will get the Fibonacci Sequence¹.
7. **Odds and Evens**: If you color the odd and even numbers, you end up with a pattern the same as the Sierpinski Triangle¹.
8. **Paths**: Each entry is also the number of different paths from the top down¹.
9. **Heads and Tails**: Pascal's Triangle shows us how many ways heads and tails can combine. This can then show us the probability of any combination¹.

In algebra and other branches of mathematics, Pascal’s Triangle lists the coefficients of the expansion of any binomial expression (x + y) n, where n is any positive integer and x and y are real numbers⁴. It's used widely in probability, combinatorics, and algebra³.
