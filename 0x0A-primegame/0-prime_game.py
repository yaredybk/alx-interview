    Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers
    starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime
    number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the
    set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

    They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round.
    Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally,
    determine who the winner of each game is."""
